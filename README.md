## Implementation Details

The system is built on a set of interconnected C++ classes, designed to manage the data and behavior of a shopping centre.

### Class Structure

* **`ShoppingCentre`**: Manages a collection of businesses. It handles adding businesses, printing lists, and performing searches and statistical queries across the entire centre.
* **`Business`**: A base class for all businesses within the shopping centre. It stores common attributes like name, size, and a list of employees. It includes virtual functions to allow for polymorphic behavior.
* **`Employee`**: Represents an employee with a first name, last name, and a Social Security Number (SSN).
* **`Restaurant`**: Inherits from `Business` and adds a specific attribute for the number of seats. It has unique methods to check seat availability and override printing behavior.
* **`Shop`**: Inherits from `Business` and includes an enum to categorize different shop types (Clothing, Technology, etc.). It overrides methods to handle its specific properties.
